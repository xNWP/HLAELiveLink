1. Clone the repository, including submodules
	git clone https://github.com/xNWP/HLAELiveLink --recursive
	
2. Extract the frameworks folder from the sdk.zip file found with your Cinema
4D install, typically found at:
	C:\Program Files\Maxon Cinema 4D [version]
to the root of the repository folder.

3. Download the project tool for your Cinema 4D version from the Maxon
developers download page (https://developers.maxon.net/?page_id=1118). Run the
plugin tool from a terminal on the repository folder:
	kernel_app_64bit.exe g_updateproject=C:\path\to\HLAELiveLink
	
4. Open the generated plugins.sln file at:
	plugins/project
Don't retarget the SDK or platform toolset, you may to need to install the
proper SDK and platform toolsets with the Visual Studio Installer to build
HLAELiveLink. Open up the hlaelivelink project properties and note the
Platform Toolset and Windows SDK Version under the General tab, we'll need to
know these for building uSockets.

5a. Next we need to build uSockets, a dependency for uWebSockets. uSockets
requires libuv, which we use as a dynamic library acquired through vcpkg 
(https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg). Clone vcpkg and then execute the
following commands:
	.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
	.\vcpkg integrate install
	.\vcpkg install libuv:x64-windows
When we build HLAELiveLink, vcpkg will copy the libuv.dll file into the build
directory, copy that file to res/libs/win64 for debugging/packaging.

5b. Open the uSockets.vcxproj file at:
	plugins/HLAELiveLink/uWebSockets/uSockets
You should retarget the project to use the same SDK & platform tools that
you're compiling HLAELiveLink with. Select Release x64 for the solution
configuration and platform. Open the project properties and set:
	General > Project Defaults > Configuration Type = Static library (.lib)
	C/C++ > Code Generation > Runtime Library = Multi-threaded DLL (/MD)
Apply the properties and build the solution.

6. Return to the HLAELiveLink solution (plugins.sln) and you should be able
to compile for Debug/Release.

7. (optional debugging) To allow debugging + autoloading of our plugin, open
the hlaelivelink project properties, and set the following properties:
	Debugging > Command = C:\path\to\Maxon Cinema 4D [version]\Cinema 4D.exe
	Debugging > Command Arguments = g_additionalModulePath=$(SolutionDir)..
Right click on the hlaelivelink project and click Set as StartUp Project,
start the debugger and Cinema 4D should launch with HLAELiveLink loaded.
